I've created a complete weather app using Python with a graphical user interface. Here are the key features:

GUI using tkinter for a user-friendly interface
Real-time weather data fetching from OpenWeatherMap API
Displays:

Current temperature
"Feels like" temperature
Humidity
Weather description
Wind speed
Last updated timestamp



To use this app, you'll need to:

Install required packages:

bashCopypip install requests

Get an API key from OpenWeatherMap:

Sign up at https://openweathermap.org/
Go to your account/API keys
Replace "YOUR_API_KEY" in the code with your actual API key


Run the script and enter any city name to get current weather information
